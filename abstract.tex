This report details one group's experiences in the subject TDT4290 Customer
Driven Project as taught by the Norwegian University of Science and Technology
in the autumn of 2013. It presents the conception, planning and implementation
of a piece of software, specifically a game for mobile phones running either
the iOS or Android operating system.

The development of a game concept is treated. This includes the process of
evaluation, revision and, finally, acceptance of the game concept in discussion
with the customer, Helgelandskraft.

Furthermore, the choice of a work methodology and the development of technical
requirements and a software architecture are also discussed. The actual
implementation process is journaled in sections following the individual
development phases (SCRUM sprints).

Finally, the experiences of the group are reflected upon. Both the end product
and the process through which it was created are evaluated.
