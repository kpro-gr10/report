\subsection{Internal Process and Results}

	(How have you worked together as a team? What have you done 
	well? What have you not done so well? What would you have done differently? Conflicts that 
	arose and how these were handled? Did you reach the project goals? What did you learn?)

	In the start of the project we had some problems with the dynamics in the group. All team members are very different in terms of how we like to work, how we communicate, our personalities as well as our experience with this kind of project. Therefore communication did not go so well and people were unsure of what were expected of them. We managed to solve this problem by discussing the problem and discovered that one of the main problems was that the role allocation and the responsibility had not been present. After we made clear what the responsibility to each role was, many of our problems were solved and we managed to work better as a team.

\subsection{The Customer and Project Task}

	(How was the communication with the customer? How did you experience the project assignment?)

	The customer is based in Mosjøen, while the team was in Trondheim. This lead us to having the 
	meetings over Skype and it took us some time to find a good way to make this work. In the beginning 
	we had some trouble finding a good way to show the customer the app and let them interact with it, 
	so that they could give us proper feedback. We provided them with a QR-code that let them install 
	the app on their own phones. This did to a certain extent make up for the fact that we could not 
	be in the same room for a meeting.

	We thought the project task sounded very interesting as it would allow us to learn to make an App, 
	something which none of the team members had done before, but which we wanted to be able to do. Also, 
	the team members enjoy playing games themselves, so making a game proved to be a fun kind of task. 
	We did however feel that the task was a bit vague in the beginning and struggled with finding a good 
	concept for a game concerning the power industry, as neither one of us had any extensive knowledge 
	in this field. However when we had agreed on a concept with the customer and the implementation could 
	start we were


\subsection{The Advisor}

	(How was communication with the advisors? Was the supervision good enough? 
	How could the course be improved to next year?)

	The advisor was very engaged in our project and 

	let us know early on if he thought we were facing difficulties or would be and how to best handle these.

	If something was unclear or we needed help we could send him a mail an he would quickly respond.

\subsection{Suggestions for Improvements}

	We do not know how much communication there were between the course staff and the customers 
	before the start of the course, but had the impression that several of the customers that 
	took part in the course for the first time did not know what to expect from the project and 
	what was expected of them. Maybe providing new customers with more information on what to expect 
	and more opportunities to ask questions before the start of the course will make it easier for 
	them to take part in it.
