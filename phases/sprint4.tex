\section{Sprint 4}

\subsection{Sprint planning}

	This is the last sprint where new features will be implemented. We plan to implement the last 
	requirements which are all rated medium and low. Several necessary improvements and some new 
	features were discovered during the usability test held in sprint 3, and these will be implemented 
	in this sprint. Some time will also be spent fixing bugs.
