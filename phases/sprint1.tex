\section{Sprint 1}

\subsection{Sprint Planning}
	In this sprint the group were planning on a small delivery. This is because we need a lot of time to get started with the development and get to know the framework Backbone. The delivery in this sprint delivery will include a graphical map with zooming functionality. To get started on implementing the other functional requirements, it requires that we have the map to put them on. 
	In order to start with the other parts of the game, it require that the group have defined and implemented all the elements in the game like building, power plants, power lines, etc.

	To be able to keep up the testing activity in the upcoming sprints, we will try to get started with unit tests. This will probably take some time since testing is a new concept to many in the group as well as Jasmine is a new framework for all in the group.
