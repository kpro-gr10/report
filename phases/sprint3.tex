\section{Sprint 3}

\subsection{Sprint planning}
	In sprint 3 the group planned on implementing the final requirements with high priority, as well as most of the requirements with medium priority. This is the second to last sprint, and it is important that in the last sprint the  only remaining requirements are medium to low requirements, so that time can also be spent fixing bugs and make the game work properly on iOS. The goal for this sprint will be to get a fully playable game, with only minor requirements missing.

	A usability test will be carried out in the last week of the sprint to discover potential bugs or errors we have yet to discover, as well as ideas for improvements that may be implemented in the next sprint.

	Concerning the report, we plan to finish the content up until this sprint.

\subsection{Duration and workload}

	{\bf Duration:} 14.10 - 27.10 (2 weeks)\\
	{\bf Workload:} This is the list with hours spent (the whole grup) on the project in this sprint.
		\item {\bf Planning:} 15.5 hours
		\item {\bf Development:} 44 hours
		\item {\bf Design:} 0 hours
		\item {\bf Documentation (report):} 59.5 hours
		\item {\bf Testing:} 20.5 hours 
	{\bf Total workload: } 139.5 hours \\

	The group's goal was to work at least 20 hours pr/person every week in this sprint. 
	The group did manage the a workload with an avrage of 17.4 hours/week (139.5 hours/4 persons/2 weeks = 20.6 hours). The reason for the low numbers is because one of the group members did not
	participate as much as he should. The 3 other group members did work over 20 hours.
