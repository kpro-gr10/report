\section{Sprint 3}

\subsection{Sprint planning}

\subsection{Expected sprint results}
	In this sprint, the group expect to be finished with the most of the requirements 
	with the critical and high priority. Sprint 4 is the last sprint, so it is important
	to only work with bugfixing and implementation of requirements with low priority.

		FR2.5 & The amount of power available to the user should be limited; 
		the power supply of a power plant should be upgradeable. & \\ \hline

		FR2.6 & The user should be able to remove power lines from the

		FR2.7 & The player should only be allowed to build a level-specific 
		number of power plants. & \\ \hline

		FR3.1 & Arbitrary power lines may be damaged throughout the game & \\ \hline

		FR3.2 & The user should be able to fix unstable power lines before it is 
		broken; this should cost some amount of money. & \\ \hline

		FR3.3 & There should be several types of buildings on the map, with different 
		power requirements & \\ \hline

		FR3.4 & Different types of building should reward different amounts of 
		money & \\ \hline

		FR4.1 & The user should be able to continue to the next level when the goal is 
		reached & \\ \hline

		FR4.3 & As the user reaches higher levels new buildings appear more 
		rapidly & \\ \hline

		FR4.4 & As the user reaches higher levels unstable power lines will appear 
		more rapidly & \\ \hline

		FR4.5 & As the user reaches higher levels the map size may increase & \\ \hline

		FR4.6 & The user should be able to win the game by reaching the goal in 
		the current level. The goal is level specific. & \\ \hline

		FR5.2 & When connecting buildings through power cables, there should be a 
		cost which is proportional to the length of the cable. & \\ \hline

		FR6.11 & The user should be able to see which houses is selected when 
		building power cables & \\ \hline

		FR6.12 & The cables should change color if it is connected to a power 
		station. & \\ \hline

		FR6.13 & The user should be able to see how much power the powerplant have 
		left. This bar should decrease if a building is connected to the powerplant 
		and should be increase if a building is removed. The colors should be yellow 
		with white background. & \\ \hline
