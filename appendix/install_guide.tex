This section will describe how to install the game on an Android phone.

\subsection*{Manual Installation}
\begin{enumerate}

	\item{} You need an application that allows you to explore the Android file
	system. If your Android device doesn't already come with an application for
	this we recommend "ES File Explorer" or "ASTRO File Manager".

	\item{} Connect your Android phone to your computer, using the Android Micro
	USB cable.

	\item{} Copy the apk file from your computer to any folder on your Android 
	phone.

	\item{} Use the file explorer application you chose to navigate to the folder 
	where you placed the apk file.

	\item{} Select the apk file and click install.

	\item{} The application is now fully installed. Click done to return to the 
	file explorer, or click open to run the game now.
