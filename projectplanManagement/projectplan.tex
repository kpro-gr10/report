\section{Project Plan}

	Table \ref{table:gantt} shows the project plan that was made in the planning phase. The project plan
	gives an overview of the main phases of the project. Each sprint also has its own activities, but
	these are not shown in this plan. 

	When the group start implementation, changes may be applied to the project plan since we
	are using scrum, as explained in the next section. Possible changes may be moving sprints or add activities. 

	The plan is divided into weeks (34-47). The first week was the kickoff of this project
	and the last week was the final delivery of the report and product.
	The first and the last week are reduced in number of days, so the total number of weeks is 13. \\
