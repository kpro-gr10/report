\section{Projectplan}

	This is the projectplan that was made in the planning phase. The projectplan
	is only a overview of the activities. Each sprint has its own activities, but
	these are not shown here in this plan. 

	When the group start implementation, changes may be applied to the project plan since we
	are working in scrum. Possible changes may be moving sprints or add activities. 

	The plan is divided into weeks (34-47). The first week was the kickoff of this project
	and the last week is the final delivery of the report and product.
	The first and the last week is reduced in number of days, so totalt weeks with work is
	only 13. \\
