\section{Project Phases}

The team mainly worked in phases called sprints. In the beginning of the project there were a 2 week period spent on preliminary studies and on planning. The next phases was the sprints (1-4). The sprints were scheduled to last for 2 weeks each with focus on the implementation of the game. The last phase was the delivery and documentation phase, where no new features were to be implemented. The phase will, however, be spent ensuring that all code produced is ready for delivery and finishing the report.

\subsection{Planning and research}
In this phase the focus was on getting startet. Every project need roles, a plan and a description of what to deliver. Fitst roles were delegated. After delegating roles the game concept was developed, and the a requirement specification was made. Subsequently it had to be decided what technology to use, which methodology to follow as well as making an overall project plan. 

\subsection{Sprints}
This phase of the project is divided into 4 phases that are called sprints and which lasts for 2 weeks. In the sprints the focus is on what features to deliver in the end of the sprint as well as making progress with the report. The sprints and their activities and results are described as own chapters in the report.

\subsection{Documentation and delivery}
This phase is the last week of the project. This is the time where no new features will be implemented, but in which it will be made sure that the game is stable and playable. It is also important to finish the final documentation in this phase.
