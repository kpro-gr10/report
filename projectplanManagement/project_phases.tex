\subsection{Project Phases}

In this project will we work in phases called sprints.
In the first period did we work in a 2weeks period where we had our preliminary study and planning. The next periods are the sprints (1-4). These periods are scheduled to last for 2 weeks each with focus on the implementation of the game. The last phase are the delivery and documentation pahse. In this phase we are not implementing any new features, but are going to ensure that all code we have produced are ready for delivery as well as finish our report.

\subsubsection{Planning and research}
In this phase we did have the focus on getting startet. Every project need roles, a plan and a description of what to deliver. We started with delegate roles. After delegating roles we had to get started with the game concept as well as a clear requirement specification. 

When we had decided on what game to make and which features to deliver, we had to decide what technology to use, what methodology to follow as well as making an overall project plan.
