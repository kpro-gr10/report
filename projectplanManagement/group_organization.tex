\subsection{Group Organization}

In this project we are only 4 people and that will affect how we organize 
the group. We will try to assign roles and responsabilities, but it will
require that each group member has more than 1 role.
In scrum there are mainly 3 roles: product owner, scrum master and the
scrum team. Since we are a small group we will have a overall flat structure. That means that
there will be traditionally project roles that will not be assigned to a specific person, 
but to the group as a whole. It will be the project managers responsability to ensure 
that activities within a unassiged role are covered during the project.

\subsubsection{Roles}

{\bf The Scrum Master (Project manager)} is the responsible person for the progress of the project 
as well as having control on the organizational tasks like planning and workload.
To keep the righ direction of the project, the project manager has to make plans for 
activities like sprints, meetings and deliveries. This include contact with customer and the supervisor.
Before every sprint, meeting and delivery, the project manager has the responsability to book a room, contact all
participants as well as creating the agenda for the meeting. \\

{\bf The Scrum Team}
