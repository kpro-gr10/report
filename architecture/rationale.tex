\subsection{Architectural Rationale}

A common architectual pattern for video games, is to use a while loop, that runs for the duration of the game. Often using some timing mechanism to update the game at a steady rate and redraws the game every frame. On a mobile platform redrawing the entire screen every frame would waste battery when no notable change has occured which needs to be redrawn. It can also be demanding on the hardware and can run badly on slower hardware. Therefore this project will be using the Model-View-Controller pattern using the JavaScript library Backbone. The purpose of using MVC is to collect all the changes that has occured, and find out which of them needs to be redrawn. MVC is not often used for modern video games, because it is common that the game needs to be redrawn every frame anyway so using MVC serves no purpose and just creates extra overhead. However for this project the screen will not need to be redrawn 30 to 60 times a second just to accommodate the high quality 3D idle animations of the game characters.
