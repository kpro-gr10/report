\subsection{Architectural Rationale}

A common architectual pattern for video games, is to use a while loop that runs for the duration 
of the game. Often using some timing mechanism to update the game at a steady rate and repaints 
the game every frame. On a mobile platform redrawing the entire screen every frame would waste 
battery when no visible change has occured. It can also be demanding on the hardware and can run 
badly on slower hardware. Therefore this project will be using the Model-View-Presenter pattern 
using the JavaScript library Backbone. The reason for using MVP is to collect all the changes 
that has occured, and find out which of them needs to be repainted. MVP also let's us make 
independent models for high cohesion and loose coupling. MVP is not often used for modern video 
games, because it is common that the game needs to be redrawn every frame anyway so using MVP 
serves no purpose and just creates extra overhead. However for this project the screen will not 
need to be redrawn 30 to 60 times a second just to accommodate the high quality 3D idle animations 
of the game characters.
