\subsection{Architectural Tactics}
In this section we will list the most important quality attributes as 
well as plan the tactis to ensure that we maintain the quality.

{\bf What is a Quality attribute? }

{\bf What is architectural tactics? }
Architectual tactics are design decisions that influence the control of a quality attribute reponse. 
Each tactic is a design option for the architect. [http://www.ece.ubc.ca/~matei/EECE417/BASS/ch05lev1sec1.html]

\subsubsection{Modifiability}
To achieve good modifiability for our code, we will use well known patterns, like MVC and create largely 
independent modules, so that changes to one part of the system has minimal effects on other parts of the 
system. The MVC pattern helps us achieve this goal. 

\subsubsection{Performance}
The most critical resource for the performance of this project is CPU power. JavaScript is not very efficient, 
so making the code efficient is very important. A tactic we will be using to achieve this is to controll the 
event sampling frequency. A typical event is a change to the game state which requires the game to be repainted. 
By only repainting the game at fixed intervals, and only repainting when a notable change has occured, we can 
improve the performance of the code.
