\subsection{Architectural Patterns}

This project will primarily be using the Model-View-Controller pattern for its architecture and will be using the JavaScript library Backbone to implement the Model-View part of the pattern, while the Controller is implemented using native JavaScript and PhoneGap.


An object representing the screen works as the view, and is notified whenever changes occur to the game models. The screen collects these events and finds out which onces will require the screen to be repainted. The screen object also functions as the controller, because the main method of interacting with the game is through the touchscreen functionality on modern smartphones.


The game runs a loop using the JavaScript requestAnimationFrame function. This loop updates the parts of the game which needs to be updated and repaints the parts of the screen which needs to be repainted.


There are 2 singleton objects in the game. One is an Image Library. This object is responsible for loading and storing the sprites the game will draw to the screen. This will allow us to only read and store each sprite one time, saving memory and improving performance. The second singleton object is the Object Pool. This object creates game objects, and stores them while they are not placed on the game map. This object will create all the objects when the game loads, so that they do not have to be created later, further improving performance. Both these singletons are commonly used in video games.
