\section{Architectural Drivers}
We are developing a game related to the power industry for Helgelandskraft. Helgelandskraft 
wants the game to be developed for Android and iOS. When the project is complete the product 
will be in the hands of Helgelandskraft and we will no longer be able to work on it. This means 
we have to use an architecture that Helgelandskraft can continue to develop with.

\subsection*{Cross Platform}
Helgelandskraft wants the product to be developed for Android and iOS. We had the choice between 
developing nativly for each platform. This would force us to develop in both Java and Objective-C 
in parallel or we would have to use a cross platform framework. We went for using a cross platform 
framework called Phonegap. Phonegap uses Javascript, HTML5 and CSS, and choosing an architecture 
which fits the language is going to be important.

\subsection*{Projected Lifetime}
The customer have to be able to continue to provide support for the game, which means that there is 
no end-time for the project from the customers point of view while the course ends at November 21. 
This means that the product needs to be easy to maintain after the end of the course.
