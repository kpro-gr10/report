\chapter{Requirement Specification}

	This chapter describes the behavior of the application, what the software will do 
	and how it will be expected to perform. Section 4.1 briefly explains some of the differences between the functional and quality requirements, as well as the scales used in the representation of the requirements. Section 4.2 presents the functional requirements, while section 4.3 presents the quality requirements. Section 4.4 contains the user stories and section 4.5 the use case diagrams, which both describe interactions the users will have with the software. Finally in section 4.6 we explain how hour estimation is performed in the project.
