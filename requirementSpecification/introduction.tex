In this section we will describe all the functional requirements
as well as the quality requirements

{\bf functional requirements vs. quality requirements}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Functional requirements: state what the system must do, how it must behave or react to run-time stimuli
	\item Quality attribute requirements: annotate (quantify) functional requirement, e.g. how fast the function 
	must be performed, how resilient it must be to erroneous input, how easy the function is to leard, etc.
\end{itemize}
