\section{User Stories}

This section will focus on the user stories in the game. Each story will be described as a scenario. All the scenarios have a certain number of attributes: Actors, preconditions, flow of events and exceptions. Before describing the flow of events, one needs to know who is involved in the scenario (the actors) and what preconditions that needs to be fulfilled in order for the scenario to take place. In the flow of events, the actions will be described step by step. If a step in the flow of events can occur, but is not a consistent part of the flow, it is described in the bottom of each table.\\
