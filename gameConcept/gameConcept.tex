\subsection{Game Concept}

"In the little town of Ohmville, electricity is in high demand. As director of the sole electric 
utility, it is your job to make sure all inhabitants are able to make coffee and play Nintendo Wii™. 
You have at your disposal a certain amount of money, as well as the ability to build power plants 
and lay cables. You are the Watcher in the Night, the Bringer of Power and the Omnipotent Ottoman."


\subsubsection{About}
The name for the game we settled on is Power Supply. It is in the construction and management simulation genre and is inspired by games like SimCity, only in a more limited scope. You are tasked with managing the delivery of electricity to cities and factories in an area, while the ultimate goal of the game is making money as the tycoon of the local power company, without going bankrupt.
