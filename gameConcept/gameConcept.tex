\subsubsection{About}
The name for the game we settled on is Power Supply. It is in the construction and management simulation genre and is inspired by games like SimCity, only in a more limited scope. You are tasked with managing the delivery of electricity to cities and factories in an area, while the ultimate goal of the game is making money as the tycoon of the local power company, without going bankrupt.
