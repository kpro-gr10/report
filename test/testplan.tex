\subsection{Test Methods}

\paragraph{Black box testing}

Black box testing examines that the functionality of the application works according to the requirements. To carry out a black box test knowledge of internal structure of the application is not neccessary. Knowledge of what the application is supposed to do is required, but no how it does it. Hence the software is viewed as a black box, where you can not see the inside, but where input is tested against output to see if the application acts as expected. The strong point of black box testing is detecting unimplemented parts of the specification or missing requirements.

\paragraph{White box testing}

White box testing on the other hand examines the internal structure of the application. In the case of white box testing the tester needs knowledge of \emph{how} the application does what it is supposed to do as well as knowledge about programming. The strong point of white box testing is its ability to uncover errors or problems, and were they are located. Black box testing can detect errors as well, but it can be harder to locate the origin of the errors.

\subsection{Testing Approach}

\subsubsection{What will be tested}

Unit testing is a very important part of every software development project. If a unit test fails it is relatively easy to detect the error, and they can be detected early in process. If, or rather when, code is changed, the impact the change has on other parts of the code can easily be determined through unit testing. Due to the limited resources
the group possesses in both time and people, unit tests will only be written if there is time. 

The main focus will lie on functionality testing. Functionality testing is a type of black box testing and it will be performed on an iPhone and an Android phone running the game app.

Usability testing will also be an imortant part of the project, considering that if users find the app diffucult to use or hard to understand, they can well decide not to use it, as there are thousands of other games out there.

A user acceptance test will be performed at the end of the project to let the customer test the final product and
approve or disapprove it.

\subsubsection{What will not be tested}


Integration testing: Because the application does not use servers or databases, an integration test would be superfluous. Testing of the application as a whole will be done through the various functional tests.

Performance testing: Tests if the system working according to the performance demands from the customer. YESNO??????

\subsection{Test Case Overview}

Test cases have been developed for the testing of the fuction of the application. Each test case has been given an identification FT-XX, where FT stands for Functional Test and XX is the number of the test.

Below is the template for the test cases.
