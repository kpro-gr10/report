\section{Functional Testing}

Functional tests will be executed to test that the implemented functionality in a given sprint works as expected.

\subsection*{Test Case Overview}

Test cases have been developed for the functional testing. Each test case has been given an identification FT-XX, where FT stands for Functional Test and XX is the number of the test.

Table \ref{table:testcasetemplate} shows the template for the test cases.
