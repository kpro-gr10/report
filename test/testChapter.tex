\chapter{Testing}

	The purpose of testing is to examine whether the product meets the requirements that guided its design 
	and development, and to find potential bugs and errors. Sections 6.1 and 6.2 contain a brief introduction 
	to different testing methods and a description of what will be tested in this project. Section 6.3 describes 
	the functional testing that will be executed and gives an overview of how the test cases for the functional 
	tests are designed and in which sprints the different tests are to be executed. Finally section 6.4 describes 
	the usability test that were carried out in sprint 3.
